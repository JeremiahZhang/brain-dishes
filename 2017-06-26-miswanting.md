论文主要介绍什么是"miswant": 当我买想要(wanting)的事物与我们得到该事物时的喜欢感(liking)不一致时,就称这种方式为"miswanted"; 以及为什么人会"miswanting",基本原因:(1)imagining the wrong event-misconstrue events(错误的思想所处情景), (2)misunderstand ourselves(不理解自己),(3)misinterpret our feelings(误解我们自身的感觉). 除此之外, 从在时间维度上看"miswanted",两个主要原因导致"miswanted"现象产生:(1)Focalism(锚定,只关注给定焦点,不考虑其他与之相关的事物,情景);(2)Immune Neglect(人自带一些情感免疫系统--免疫忽略能力).

如何避免"miswanting",文中没有详细讲解.

# Imagining the Wrong Event

# Using the Wrong Theory

# Misinterpretting Feelings

Wantings are based on three ingredients:

- the partiular details that we imagine when we consider a future event;
- our beliefs about the ways in which people like us are likely to react to such events;
- and the "gut reactions"(本能反应) we experience when we imagine the event.

Just as the first two of these ingredients can lead us to miswant, so too can the third.

How so?

The crux of the problem is that the feelings we experience when we imagine a future event are not necessarily or solely caused by that act of imagination. We may feel enormously excited when we contemplate spending next Sunday at the circus, and thus we may drop buckets of money on ringside tickets without realizing that the good news we received about our aging uncle's miraculous recovery from psoriasis just moments before we purchased our ticket has contaminated our affective reaction to the thought of dancing elephants (Wilson & Brekke, 1994). Come Sunday, we may find ourselves bored to tears beneath the big top, wondering why we paid good money to see a herd of clowns in a little car.

Our miswanting in this case would not have been a result of having imagined the wrong event ("Oh, I was thinking of a flea circus") nor of having had a false conception of ourselves ("Why did I think I liked men in floppy shoes?"). Rather, we would have miswanted because when we initially thought about the circus we felt excited, and we took that fact as information about the circus rather than as information about Uncle Frank's remission. Feelings do not say where they come from, and thus it is all too easy for us to attribute them to the wrong source.

Experimental demonstrations of this home truth abound. People may mistakenly believe that their lives are empty when, in fact, their gloomy mood is a consequence of rain (Schwarz & Clore, 1983); They may mistakenly believe that a person is attractive when, in fact, their pounding pulse is being caused by the swaying of a suspension bridge (Dutton & Aron, 1974); and so on. Because we cannot always tell if the feelings we are having as we imagine an event being caused solely by that imagining, we may use these feeling as proxies for future liking, and hence, miswant.

# Miswanting Over Time

What do spaghetti, cheeseburgers, marshmallow cookies, tortilla chips, and Snicker bars have in common? They are objects that can be wanted today and liked tormorrow, but once that liking occurs, they quickly becaom a trivial bit of personal history that only our thighs remember.

Significant events are supposed to have significant emotional consequences, and the duration of these consequences matters a lot.

Gilbert, Pinel, Wilson, Blumberg, and Wheatley (1998) have suggested that people tend to overestimate the duration of their emotional reactions to future events --- especially negative events --- and that this can lead them to miswant in the long term.

What might cause people to overestimate the enduring emotional impact of such events?

## Focalism: The Invisible Future

But how we will feel in general a year after losing a hand, and how we will feel about losing a hand a year after the loss, are not the same thing. Predicting the latter may be relatively simple, but predicting the former requires that we estimate the combined impact of the focal event and all the nonfocal events that follow it. Put another way, our general happiness some time after an event is influenced by just two things: (1) the event, and (2) everything else. If we estimate that happiness by considering only the event, then we are ignoring some of the most powerful determinants of our future well-being (see Loewenstein & Schkade, in press Schkade & Kahneman, 1997).

Wilson, Wheatley, Meyers, Gilbert, and Axsom (1998) demonstrated how focalism (the failure to consider the consequences of nonfocal events when making predictions about the ultimate affective impact of focal events) can give rise to the durability bias and hence promote miswanting. College students were asked to predict their happiness the day after their football team won or lost an important game. Some students were also asked to complete a "future diary" in which they listed the events that they thought would occur in the 3 days after the game. Those students who completed the diary, and who were thus most likely to consider the impact of future nonfocal events when makeing their predictions, made less extreme predictions about their general happiness --- predictions that turned out to be more accurate when their overall happiness was measured the day after the game.

It seems that merely considering the emotional impact of an event can lead us to overestimate that impact, simply because we do not also consider other impactful events as well. Focalism is an especially vexing problem because avoiding it seems to require that we do the impossible, namely, consider the impact of every event before estimating the impact of any event. If we think of happiness as a general state that is determined by innumerable events, it does indeed seem likely that no single event will have the power to influence our general happiness for very long. Indeed, those events that seem to make a big difference (e.g., moving to a new country) tend to be those that give rise to many other events, which suggests that the ramifications of an event --- that is, the sheer number of experiences it alters - may be the best predictor of its ultimate emotional impact. Although few parents would believe it, the death of a spouse may have more impact than the death of a child, simply because the former produces more changes in one's life than does the latter (see Lehman et al., 1993).

In any case, it seems quite clear that focusing on an event can cause us to overestimate the duration of its influence on our happiness, and, hence, to miswant.

## Immune Neglect: The Invisible Shield

Immune bais.

Many shrewd observers of the human condition have remarked on people's extraordinary ability to change the way they feel simply by changing the way they think.

...

Taken together, the mechanisms that protect the sources of our psychological well-being(e.g., our sense of competence, integrity, and worth) in the face of assault constitute a pyschological immune system that seems to be both powerful and invisible to the person it serves.

...

Gilbert et al. (1998) provided direct experimental evidence of immune neglect: the tendency for people to fail to consider how readily their psychological immune systems will vitiate their despair.

...

Most of us find it rather uncomfortable to interact with people we do not like, and so we are highly motivated to like those with whom we must interact.(Darley & Bersheild, 1967)

...

Immune neglect can cause us to miswant by causing us to fear and avoid outcomes that will not, in the long run, hinder our happiness.

But one ironic consequence of the failure to anticipate the operation of the pyschological immune system is that we may inadvertently do things that impair its operation, thereby undermining our own hidden talent for happiness.
